        <p>Kevin (Fargie) and Yana met through mutual friends one evening in 2009, in their respective pursuits of social exploration and merrymaking, on the rooftop lounge at Crush in The Woodlands, TX.  This seemingly insignificant happenstance slowly transformed into perpetual fun for the two as time went by.  Fargie and Yana (Yargie) became part of a tight-knit group of socialite fun-junkies that were never once accused of not seizing every opportunity to maximize the entertainment factors in their lives.  Regulars on the Houston social scene, Yargie soon set their sights on other locations, traveling to Austin, New York, Dallas and Las Vegas.   As time went by something began to change in their friendship.  As the wise sages of the legendary band REO Speedwagon put it: “What started out as friendship has grown stronger.”   Being the hairy baboon that Kevin is, he started noticing that he did not particularly like when the other males of the species would talk to Yana and on multiple occasions he attempted to smooch on Yana.  However, Yana typically retorted with something along the lines of “Ewww!”. (Pretty sure she secretly she liked it though.)   But Yana eventually could not resist Kevin’s charm and allowed a courtship to begin in May of 2012.</p>
        <p>After a year and some change of dating, Kevin had confirmed that Yana was the “the one” for him.   After much research, speculation, searching, praying, reflection and engrossment, he purchased the diamond that he seeked and had a ring made. Yargie planned to go on their second annual trip to Puerto Rico over New Years 2014.  Since Yargie dabbles in amateur iphoneography and loves taking pictures, Kevin lined up a photographer to take some couples photos of them on Flamenco Beach on Isla Culebra in Puerto Rico.  Near the end of the photo shoot, Kevin got down on one knee, presented Yana with the ring and proposed.  To the cheers of other lucky beach goers, Yana said “yes”, and the rest of this story is waiting to be written!</p>
